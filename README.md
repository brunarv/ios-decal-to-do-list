# Lab 5: To-Do List #

## Due ##
Tuesday, March 7 at 11:59 PM

## Description ##
In this lab, you will build your own Utility app - a To-Do List. Once you're done, you should be able to view your existing tasks, mark a task as completed, delete a task, and add new tasks. As long as your application conforms every one of our required criteria (see below), you can add whatever additional features, views, UI, etc. you want. 

Here's an example of what we are looking for:

## Instructions ##
For this project we will not give you any starter code, we want you implement the entire app yourself!

## Requirements ##

You **must** have the two classes described below (feel free to name them as you please). In addition, you should satisfy the general requirements below. 

###  Table View Controller of To-Do List Items ###
- [ ] Ability to visually mark a task as completed
- [ ] Ability to visually unmark a task as completed
- [ ] Ability to delete a task
- [ ] Button to add a To-Do Item (goes to Add To-Do Item View)

- [ ] Ability to add a task, where entering text and confirming returns to the To-Do List Table View, now updated with the new task added
- [ ] Ability to cancel and return to To-Do List Table View without adding a task

###  General Requirements ###
- [ ] Create a Universal app when you construct your Xcode project.
- [ ] UI must scale to iPhone 7 and up and all iPads in both Portrait and Landscape orientations.
  * Hint: Think Auto-Layout. For UILabels, autoshrink in the Attributes
  Inspector is also useful. 

## Bells & Whistles (Optional) ##
1. Make the data persistent, so that when you close the application and reopen
  it, your pre-existing tasks are restored.
2. Make it live up to the iOS design standards (you can submit this app to the App Store).
3. Notifications 
4. Mark all as complete button
5. Any others that you think will impress us!
